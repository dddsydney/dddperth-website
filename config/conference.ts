      SessionAbstract: `Having different ideas, opinions, interests can be quite lonely and lead to thinking about where you can fit especially in the fast-paced tech industry.

Coming to the industry, not by a traditional path, being the only one in the room to have a unique opinion can be very intimidating. Being unique can put us in a position where we think that we don't belong here.

After 5 years in tech being different brought me to this state - a software engineer, a founder of the Australia wide diversity community Muses Code JS, a co-organizer of the international organization Women Who Code, Google Developer Expert in Web technologies and international speaker. Being different is great!`,

Alternatively, have you seen a talented colleague not recognising their own achievements? A colleague hesitant to take on a new role?

This is imposter syndrome; I encounter it constantly and fight against it in myself and others. I want you to unite with me in this battle; for yourself, your colleagues and friends.

Join me as I share my experiences with imposter syndrome, how I have fought against it and how you can join the fight.`,
